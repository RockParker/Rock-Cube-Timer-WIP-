Currently working on:

	> (Completed) << I don't like JSON Files but they are very nice for object storage !!!!!>> 
				need to make the method that reads the json files

	> (Completed) << not enough bug testing yet >> 
				should then add in the part that takes the deserialized json files and turns them back into clickable buttons in the timeslist panel

	> (Completed) << not enough bug testing yet >> 
				I would like to turn the window that opens into a little drop down that holds the buttons with the values
		
		>>Maybe add a way for people to make a custom theme on the fly. shouldn't be toooooo hard. I have no idea though

	> ??Maybe should add something that allows you to delete some times incase there is something programmatically wrong or pebkac

	> settings loader for when the program has just started

		> Should load the cube that was "active" before the program was closed
			> should load the list of times associated with the cube
			> wouldn't hurt to generate a scramble relevant to the cube

		> (Completed) << I hope it continues to work well >>
					Should load the theme that was active before the program was closed

		> (Completed) << Works, lets hope it stays that way>>

		> (Completed) << it is easy to tell now >>
