If anyone is just bored and scrolling through this repository for some reason. I struggle with design, and I think it would be really nice if anyone
wants to pitch any ideas for new colours or layout, etc.

Also, if anyone has a more efficient method, and would be willing to stop and take a few minutes to explain how the new logic works, i would love to
implement it and I think it would be super cool to learn things from this community
